# Multi-Step Form with Wizard

This is a simple multi-step form component built using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS (to handle the button transitions in the wizard).

There are lots of ways to build more complex components (for example, using UseReducer or Redux) but this component uses useContext to keep track of the step that the user is currently on. I hope you find this useful!
